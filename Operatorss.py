#  Operators in Python
# 1. Arithmetic Operators.
# 2. Assignment Operators.
# 3. Comparison Operators.
# 4. Logical Operators.
# 5. Identity Operators.
# 6. Membership Operators.
# 7. Bitwise Operators.


# 1. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
#print("Arithmetic Operators")
#print("5 + 6 is ",5+6)   #Adiition
#print("5 - 6 is ",5-6)   #Substraction
#print("5 * 6 is ",5*6)   #Multiplication
#print("5 / 6 is ",5/6)   #Division
#print("5 // 6 is ",5//6) #It gives an integer value after dividing
#print("5 ** 6 is ",5**6) #It gives exponential value that is (5 to the power 6)
#print("5 % 3 is ", 5%3)  #It is modulus operator (gives remainder,also known as remainder operator)
#print("\n \n \n")

# 2. Assignment Operators.
#print("Assignment Operators")
#x = 5
#x += 7
#print(x)  #Here x becomes 12 So,12/5 = 2.4
#x //= 5   #Here 12 // 5 gives 2 (integer value).
#print(x)
#x -= 1
#x %= 4
#print(x)

# 3. Comparison Operators.
#i = 8
#print(i == 5)  #This == only compares the value in this case the value of i is 8 so it gives us a false output because of comparison.

#i = 5
#print(i == 5)
#print(i < 5)
#print(i > 5)
#print(i != 5)
#print(i >= 5)
#print(i <= 5)
#print(i<5)

# 4. Logical Operators.
a = True
b = False
#print(a and a)
#print(a and b)
#print(b and b)
#print(a or a)
#print(a or b)
#print(b or b)

# 5. Identity Operators.
#print(a is b)
#print(a is not b)
#print(a is a)
#print(b is b)
#print(5 is not 7)

# 6. Membership Operators.
#list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
#print(3 in list)   #Gives True output.
#print(11 in list)  #Gives False output.
#print(11 not in list)  # Gives True output.
## Gives Membership accurance


# 7. Bitwise Operators.
# 0 - 00
#1 - 01
#2 - 10
#3 - 11

print(0 & 1)
